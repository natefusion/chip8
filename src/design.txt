## Chip8 assembler general desgin ##

Load file into string.

Create tokens from the string

Tokens are deliminated by whitespace

A Token struct should contain this information:
        The kind of token
                Func:  any token that performs an action on parameters
                Reg:   any of the registers on the chip8 (i, v[0-f], dt, st, key (not a real register))
                Const: any number
                Ident: any string of characters that doesn't start with a number
                
        The specific token (e.g. draw, define, i...) (This should probably be contained inside of the kind of token)
        The raw token (a string)
        The line that it was located on
        the character on that line that it was located on

(When should I separate the V register? Now? Later? Earlier?)

The next step is to organize our data into using this Function struct:
        Func
        All following tokens until the next Func

Next step is to grab all of the "define"s and ":"s and do a search and replace

Then turn the consts into numbers types and put all the information into the Instruction struct

An Instruction struct should contain this information:
        Mnemonic: a specific token representing one of the 34 mnemonics
        register: an array of specific tokens representing registers
        argument: an array of specific tokens representing constants
